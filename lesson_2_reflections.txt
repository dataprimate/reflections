What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repositiry a .git file is created. 
It is up to the user to them create the first commit.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is where the files are placed ready to form part of a commit.
The working directory contains files which may not be part of a commit and is just a place on the computer which contains the files. The repository is actually connected to git.
The staging area is useful to manage which files are part of which commmit, rather than placing all of them ito the commit.
